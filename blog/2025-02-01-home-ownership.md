What does a morning cup of coffee and home ownership aspirations have in common?

<!-- truncate -->

Thank you to my clients for the inspiration for this article.
Sometimes buying a home may involve looking at many properties to find what you
want, that is, if you are not certain what you would like your ideal home to be.
If you could picture yourself enjoying a cup of coffee in an idyllic setting where
would it be?

On a deck overlooking a forest? Or a sunny location with an ocean view? Would it
be at a gourmet kitchen counter? Or at a villa in Mexico? In a sunny high-rise with
your high tech coffee maker? Or in an enclosed patio full of fragrant flowers?
As a real estate agent who understands a client's needs as well as dreams,
answers to those questions are an imaginative way to understand your home
ownership aspirations.

Buying an ideal home means that your Realtor understands what you want. Just ‘a
house’ won’t do. If you like forested properties, it may mean you would like a rural
or semi-rural lifestyle. If you want a gourmet kitchen, a suitable kitchen space
would be the key aspect of your home search. Would you love to be in Mexico for
half the year? Then a 'lock it and leave it' condo would be ‘your thing’. New condos
or pre-sale condos provide the opportunity to own a maintenance free modern
home with all the new gadgets. Strata patio homes are great for single level living
with an outdoor space and low maintenance.

Where do you picture yourself?
Once you have decided where your idyllic setting is to enjoy your morning coffee,
the next step is to work toward your home ownership aspirations is to prepare
financially.

Contact a mortgage specialist and start planning. Financial planning and readiness
will help get you to your home ownership goals. If upsizing, start saving in a TFSA
and start paying off any outstanding debts. Speak to your mortgage broker before
you retire to take advantage of employment income. If you plan to down size,
think about investing into the next generation of homeowners (children) or invest
your money with retirement goals in mind.

I want to help you attain your real estate dreams. Contact me, Vida Glaser, a
