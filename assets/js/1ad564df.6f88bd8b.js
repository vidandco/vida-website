For those who may have not yet taken\\nadvantage of government incentives, don\u2019t wait too long. There may be shifting\\npriorities in government spending. Take advantage of current rebates on EV\\nchargers, solar panels and upgrading your heating system to a heat\\npump and upgrading insulation and windows. Rebates are all available from BC\\nHydro through provincial funding, offering rebates up to $5,000 on eligible grid-\\nconnected solar panels and up to an additional $5,000 for battery storage systems\\nto qualifying residential customers. The BC HYDRO website is very easy to use.\\nLast week I received a $600 rebate for an EV charger installed at my home!\\n\u201cRebates for (electricity) self-generation are one of the ways that we\'re\\nhelping to meet the province\'s growing need for renewable electricity and\\nproviding owners with more options for managing their energy use.\u201d\\nBefore you renovate, check out the incentives that will inch your home closer to a\\nlower carbon footprint and ultimately a passive home.\\nhttps://www.betterhomesbc.ca/rebates/energy-savings-program/\\nhttps://www.bchydro.com/powersmart/residential/rebates-programs/home-\\nrenovation.html\\n\\nPassive homes ( low carbon footprint homes) have been built mostly in Europe, but\\nare catching on in Canada.\\n\\"Passive homes aim to achieve the highest level of energy efficiency and climate-\\nconsciousness possible by designing the home\'s function and style based on its\\ngeographical location, solar orientation, and climatic region. High-efficiency\\nheating and cooling systems, as well as heat recovery ventilation (HRV) systems,\\nare incorporated, to further reduce the amount of energy needed to heat and cool\\nthe home. Passive houses consume up to 90 percent less heating and cooling\\nenergy than conventional buildings. Renewable energy systems such as solar\\nphotovoltaic (solar panels) are often installed so that the building generates all of\\nits energy needs. With all of these features, passive houses produce little to no\\ngreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, making them sustainable and climate-friendly.\\"\\n\\nCanadian Federal government has recently implemented\u201cThe Canada Green Buildings Strategy: Transforming Canada\u2019s buildings\\nsector for a net-zero and resilient future.\\nThe Canadian Net-Zero Emissions Accountability Act enshrines in legislation the\\nGovernment of Canada\u2019s commitment to reduce GHG emissions by 40-45% below\\n2005 levels by 2030 and to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Buildings\\naccount for 18% of Canada\u2019s emissions.\u201d\\nThe CGBS centers around three priorities:\\n1. Accelerate retrofits\\n2. Build green and affordable from the start\\n3.
